This project implements an editor extension for Unity3D to create 3D Low Poly Landscapes. It is still under development, but can be used for testing purposes.

Some examples of procedurally-generated landscapes with automatic terrain-fillings are shown below. An example video of post-editing generated landscapes can be watched here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moRNfwl1JoU
